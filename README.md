  * (You can get the address on "Servers" tab in Acquia UI)
  * `cd ~`
  * `git clone git@github.com:morpht/letsencrypt_acquia.git`
* In project root
  * Add letsencrypt_acquia configuration.
    * `git clone git@github.com:morpht/letsencrypt_acquia.git tmp_lea` # Temporarily get the repo to get exmple configs.
    * `cp -r tmp_lea/example_project_config/* .` # Copy the config.
    * `rm -rf tmp_lea/`
    * Edit `letsencrypt_acquia/config.sh` 
      * You need to set your e-mail. The script provides the rest of defaults needed to get a certificate.
      * You can alter other values as described here: https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated/blob/master/docs/examples/config
    * Edit `letsencrypt_acquia/domains_site.env.txt`
      * Rename it based on site alias you are going to be using.
      * For multiple environments create multiple copies of this file.
      * One line, space separated list of domains.
      * First domain will be set as Common name
      * Others are set as SANs
    * Edit `letsencrypt_acquia/slack.sh`
      * Slack is optional. If you don't want to use it, just delete this file.
      * Get your webhook url here: https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/
      * Set the webhook url and target channel variables.
  * Add https://www.drupal.org/project/letsencrypt_challenge module.
    * `composer require drupal/letsencrypt_challenge`
  * Commit and deploy to production.
* In Acquia UI add the Scheduled task
  * Runnig the task often is not a problem.
  * Ideal is once a week, ideally on Monday morning.
    * Nobody wants to fix certificates on Friday evening :)
    * You should have 30 days of time (with default settings) even if something fails or new manual certificate upload is needed.
  * New job:
    * Job name: `LE renew cert` (just a default, feel free change it)
    * Command: `/home/PROJECT/letsencrypt_acquia/letsencrypt_acquia.sh @PROJECT.PROD /var/www/html/PROJECT.PROD &>> /var/log/sites/${AH_SITE_NAME}/logs/$(hostname -s)/letsencrypt_acquia.log`
    * Command frequency `0 7 * * 1` ( https://crontab.guru/#0_7_*_*_1 )
  * It's good idea to run the command on Acquia manually or set the cron to run every minute for a bit so you don't have to wait.
* First script run will post instructions to Slack.
